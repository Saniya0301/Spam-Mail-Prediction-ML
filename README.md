# Spam Mail Prediction using Machine Learning


---

## Overview
This project implements a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam (ham). It uses textual features—often obtained via techniques like TF-IDF or count vectorization—to train a classifier that can automatically flag suspicious emails and streamline inbox management.

---

## Dataset
- **Source**: A labeled dataset containing email texts and their corresponding spam/ham labels.
- **Format**: Typically a CSV file (e.g., `emails.csv`) with columns such as `text` (email body) and `label` (spam or ham).

---

Getting Started
Explore the data in the provided Jupyter notebook:

Load emails.csv

Inspect class distribution and visualize common words


Clean and preprocess text (e.g., remove stopwords, perform stemming)

---
Feature Engineering:

Apply TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer to convert text into numerical features

---

Model Training:

---

Train classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Random Forest

---
Model Evaluation:

Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix



---


Findings & Insights
Models like Naive Bayes often perform well in text classification tasks like spam detection.


Proper text preprocessing (e.g., removing noise, tokenizing) significantly improves accuracy.


Imbalanced datasets may require techniques like stratified sampling or class weighting.


---
Future Improvements
Expand data sources to include different languages or formats (e.g., HTML emails).

Implement hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

Add ensemble methods (e.g., Gradient Boosting) for better performance.

Deploy as a web app or integrate with email clients for real-time usage.
